 <li>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than on
 Mercury.
  <li>In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".
<li> The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
 distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.<li> Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
 atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar 
 ice caps of Earth.</i></ul>
