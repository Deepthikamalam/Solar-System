<p> <i><font size=5>Sun A star located in the center of the solar system , around which the Earth and other components of the solar system revolve. The Sun is the largest body in our solar system and its diameter is about 
13 lakh 90 thousand kilometers which is about 109 times more than the Earth. This powerful storehouse of energy is primarily a giant ball of hydrogen and helium gases. The Sun produces energy in its 
center by the process of nuclear fusion . Only a small part of the energy released from the Sun reaches the Earth, of which 15 percent is reflected in space, 30 percent is used to vaporize the water and 
many of the energy is absorbed by the plants and seas. Its strong gravity Shakti, rotating in different orbits, pulls the earth and other planets towards it.</i></p>
