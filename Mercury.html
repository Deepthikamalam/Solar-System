<ul type="square"> <i><font size=5> <li>Mercury, the solar system 's smallest and eight planets of the sun 's closest planet.<li> Its orbital period is about 88 days. 
<li>When viewed from Earth , it appears to revolve around its orbit in 116 days, which is the fastest among the planets. 
<li> Since its atmosphere is almost negligible in terms of retaining heat, Mercury's crust experiences the most temperature.
<li> Mercury does not experience any of the same seasons as other planets like Earth.<li> It is clamped so its path of rotation is 
unique in the solar system.<li> Viewed relative to a stationary star, it rotates around its axis exactly three times during every
 two orbital revolutions.<li> Viewed from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates at orbital speed, it appears to rotate
 only once every two Mercury years.<li> For this reason an observer on the planet Mercury will see one day every two years.</i></ul>
