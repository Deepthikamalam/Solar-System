<p> <i><font size=5> Mercury, the solar system 's smallest and eight planets of the sun 's closest planet. Its orbital period is about 88 days. 
When viewed from Earth , it appears to revolve around its orbit in 116 days, which is the fastest among the planets. 
Since its atmosphere is almost negligible in terms of retaining heat, Mercury's crust experiences the most temperature.
Mercury does not experience any of the same seasons as other planets like Earth. It is clamped so its path of rotation is 
unique in the solar system. Viewed relative to a stationary star, it rotates around its axis exactly three times during every
 two orbital revolutions. Viewed from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates at orbital speed, it appears to rotate
 only once every two Mercury years. For this reason an observer on the planet Mercury will see one day every two years.</i> </p>
