<li>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known Solar planet from the Sun. 
<li>In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
<li>It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
<li>Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
<li>The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi).
<li>It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.</i></ul>
