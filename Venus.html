Roman goddess of love and beauty . It is the brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon . Its apparent
magnitude reaches a level of -4.6 and is bright enough to cast a shadow. Since Venus is an inferior planet ,
it is never seen far from the Sun when viewed from Earth: its obtuse angleReaches a maximum of 47.8 degrees. 
Venus reaches its maximum brightness before sunrise or only briefly after sunset. This is the reason for which it has 
been referred to by ancient cultures as the morning star or the evening star.</i></p>
