 <li>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more thantwo and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth
 the mass of the Sun.
  <li>Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. 
   <li>It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because 
of its observed size.
    <li>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one quarter of its mass and one
 tenth of its volume.</i></p>
